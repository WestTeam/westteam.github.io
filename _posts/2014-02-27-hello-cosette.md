# Eurobot 2017: Moon village

In March 2016, ESA (European Space Agency) has revealed its Moon Village project which will take place in 20 years. The goal is to build a permanent plant on the Moon surface with resources gathered in situ.

It is within this context that your robots will set out to conquer the Moon!

Your mission, should you accept it, will consist of:

Collecting titanium ores extracted from the lunar soil and collecting lunar modules sent back from Earth by rockets.
Building a Moon base with the help of the lunar modules sent from Earth and the ones already presents on the Moon.
Funny action: launching a spacecraft in order to prepare flights leaving for planet Mars.
You can find more information about the new contest in the rules.

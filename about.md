CVRA (Club Vaudois de Robotique Autonome) is a group of students and engineers passionate about robotics. It is based in Renens, Switzerland. We build autonomous robots as part of the European robotics competition Eurobot.

Our members come from different backgrounds, thus bringing skills and knowledge to the club in various fields such as mechanical engineering, manufacturing, electronics and software. This allows us to build relatively complex robots such as Debra, our main competing robot since 2011 featuring two articulated arms.

Open source

Our club is a strong supporter of open source and we try to make our projects available under a free license (MIT or Creative Commons):
We host all of our code and our electronics designs on Github.
Some of our mechanical designs are available on GrabCAD.
